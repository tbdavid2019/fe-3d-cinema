Role:
Act as an expert frontend creative developer specializing in Three.js, WebGL, and Computer Vision (MediaPipe Hands). Your task is to create a high-performance, single-file HTML application featuring a cyberpunk interactive particle system.
Visual Style:
• Theme: Hardcore Cyberpunk.
• Background: Deep black with subtle moving grid/scanlines and a vignette effect.
• HUD: Minimalist data display in the four corners (FPS, Particle Count, Hand Status), using the Orbitron or monospaced font in Neon Cyan.
• Material: Particles must use AdditiveBlending for a glowing, neon look.
Core Parameters:
• Particle Count: 12,000.
• Particle Size: 2.4.
• Physics: Fast return speed (lerp factor 0.16). Strong and snappy repulsion force.
Interaction Logic (Detailed Requirements):
1. Left Hand (Command Controller):
Detect the number of extended fingers to switch the target shape and color of the particles:
• 1 Finger: Text "Hello" | Color: Neon Blue (0x00FFFF).
• 2 Fingers: Text "David888" | Color: Neon Yellow (0xFFFF00).
• 3 Fingers: Text "我愛你" (Chinese for "Very Useful") | Color: Neon Pink (0xFF00FF).
• 4 Fingers: Text "再見" (Chinese for "Goodbye") | Color: Neon Green (0x00FF88).
• 5 Fingers (Open Palm): Enter "Catch Mode" (acts as a destination container).
2. Right Hand (Physics Interactor):
• Tracking Point: Always track the Index Finger Tip (Landmark 8).
• State A (Pointing/Fist - Default):
• Interaction: When touching text particles, trigger a Strong Scatter effect.
• Constraint: Pure planar repulsion (XY axis). Do NOT apply any Z-axis bulge or distortion (keep it flat).
• State B (Open Hand - 5 Fingers):
• Trigger: "Nebula Mode". Particles scatter to fill the entire screen 3D space.
• Interaction: Applying a "Water Ripple" (sine wave) effect when the hand moves through the particles.
3. Dual Hand Combo (Ultimate Effect):
• Condition: When Right Hand is Open (Nebula active) AND Left Hand is Open (Catch active) simultaneously.
• Effect Logic:
• All full-screen particles are instantly attracted to the Left Hand Palm center.
• Shape: Particles form a Rotating 3D Basketball in the left hand (Orange color, using Fibonacci sphere distribution, with calculated black lines to simulate ball texture).
• Motion Trajectory: Particles must fly towards the left hand with a Bouncing/Jumping trajectory (high-frequency Y-axis sine wave), looking like thousands of energetic bouncing beads.
Technical Implementation:
• Use Canvas pixel scanning to generate text coordinates (Font size: 75px, bold).
• Configure MediaPipe Hands to detect a maximum of 2 hands.
• No mobile-specific constraints (use default webcam settings).
• Ensure the code is self-contained in a single index.html file (CSS, JS, HTML combined).
